# AWS EC2 Instance Management Platform - Project Brief

## 1. Executive Summary

The AWS EC2 Instance Management Platform is a full-stack web application designed to provide a streamlined interface for viewing and managing Amazon EC2 instances within a specific AWS account and region. This platform will serve as a centralized dashboard for authorized users to monitor instance status and perform limited administrative actions based on their assigned roles.

The solution leverages modern cloud-native technologies including React with Material-UI for the frontend, AWS services for backend infrastructure, and follows best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability. The platform implements role-based access control with two distinct user types: read-only users who can view instance information, and admin users who can additionally perform instance reboot operations.

## 2. Project Overview
