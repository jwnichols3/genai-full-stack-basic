Architecture document is now complete. All sections have been populated based on the PRD requirements and existing technical documentation. The architecture provides a comprehensive blueprint for building the AWS EC2 Instance Management Platform using modern serverless patterns and fullstack best practices.

Key architectural decisions made:
- Serverless backend using Lambda and API Gateway for operational simplicity
- React SPA with Material-UI for responsive, professional UI
- AWS Cognito for managed authentication with role-based access
- DynamoDB for audit logging with efficient query patterns
- Monorepo structure with shared types for frontend/backend consistency
- Comprehensive testing strategy with 80% coverage target
- Security-first approach with CSP headers, input validation, and rate limiting

The document serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development and can be used to generate consistent, high-quality code across the entire stack.
