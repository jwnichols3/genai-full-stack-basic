# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://*.amazonaws.com`
- XSS Prevention: React's built-in escaping, input sanitization, DOMPurify for user content
- Secure Storage: Tokens in memory only, no localStorage/sessionStorage for sensitive data

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Joi schemas for all API inputs
- Rate Limiting: 100 req/sec sustained, 200 req/sec burst per IP
- CORS Policy: Strict origin validation, credentials included

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: In-memory with secure HTTP-only refresh token cookie
- Session Management: 8-hour access tokens, 30-day refresh tokens
- Password Policy: Min 12 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol required

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 300KB gzipped initial bundle
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting by route, lazy loading for heavy components
- Caching Strategy: Immutable assets with hash names, 1-year cache headers

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: p50 < 200ms, p99 < 500ms
- Database Optimization: DynamoDB on-demand scaling, GSI for common queries
- Caching Strategy: CloudFront edge caching for GET requests, 5-minute TTL
