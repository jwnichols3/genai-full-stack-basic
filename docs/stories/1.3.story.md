# Story 1.3: Implement Cognito User Pool and Authentication

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** security administrator,
**I want** AWS Cognito properly configured with pre-registered users,
**So that** only authorized users can access the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2:

- CDK infrastructure successfully deployed with comprehensive AWS resources
- Base stack architecture in infrastructure/lib/app-stack.ts ready for Cognito integration
- Environment-specific configuration loading from .env files functional
- Stack outputs properly configured for cross-stack references
- CDK testing framework already implemented with Jest
- AWS profile "jnicamzn-sso-ec2" configured and deployment validated

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization - managed service with built-in security features
- **IaC Tool:** AWS CDK 2.100+ for Infrastructure as Code with TypeScript (already v2.214.0 from Story 1.2)
- **Backend Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ for type-safe development
- **Backend Testing:** Jest 29.x for CDK testing (already configured)

### Data Models Context

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- **User Model:** userId (Cognito UUID), email (unique), role ('admin' | 'readonly'), firstName, lastName, lastLogin, createdAt
- **Custom Attributes:** role attribute required as 'custom:role' for authorization
- **Pre-registered Users:** 4 users total with mix of admin/readonly roles
- **JWT Claims:** Must include custom:role attribute for API Gateway authorization

### Backend Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

- **Authentication Flow:** Cognito JWT validation through API Gateway authorizer
- **JWT Verification:** CognitoJwtVerifier for access token validation with userPoolId and clientId
- **Role-Based Access:** Authorizer extracts custom:role from JWT claims for function authorization
- **Environment Variables:** COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID and COGNITO_CLIENT_ID required for authorizer

### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- **CDK Stack Location:** infrastructure/lib/stacks/auth-stack.ts (future separated stack) - currently in app-stack.ts
- **User Seeding Script:** scripts/seed-users.ts for Cognito user creation
- **Test Files:** infrastructure/tests/unit/ for CDK unit tests
- **Configuration:** Environment variables in .env.dev/.env.prod files

### Coding Standards Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode configuration (already configured)
- **Environment Variables:** Access through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Naming Conventions:** camelCase functions, PascalCase constructs, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants
- **Error Handling:** All operations must use standard error handling patterns

### File Locations and Structure

Based on current infrastructure and project structure:

- **CDK Stack:** infrastructure/lib/app-stack.ts (add Cognito resources to existing comprehensive stack)
- **User Seeding Script:** scripts/seed-users.ts for user creation automation
- **Test Files:** infrastructure/tests/unit/app-stack.test.ts (add Cognito tests to existing test file)
- **Environment Config:** Use existing .env.dev/.env.prod for Cognito configuration
- **Stack Outputs:** Add to existing outputs in app-stack.ts for User Pool ID, Client ID, and domain

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test Framework:** Jest 29.x for CDK unit testing (already configured)
- **Test Location:** infrastructure/tests/unit/ for CDK stack tests
- **Coverage Requirements:** Minimum 80% coverage for authentication logic
- **Test Standards:** Follow testing pyramid with emphasis on unit tests for CDK constructs
- **Specific Tests:** User Pool configuration, password policy, client settings, custom attributes

### Technical Constraints

- **CDK Version:** 2.100+ (already using v2.214.0)
- **AWS Environment:** Profile "jnicamzn-sso-ec2", region "us-west-2" (already configured)
- **Token Expiration:** 8 hours for access tokens as per AC requirements
- **Password Policy:** Min 8 chars with upper/lower/digit requirements (no symbols required)
- **Custom Attributes:** custom:role attribute for role-based authorization

### CDK Implementation Details

**Cognito User Pool Configuration:**

```typescript
// infrastructure/lib/app-stack.ts
import { CfnUserPool, CfnUserPoolClient, CfnUserPoolDomain } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';

const userPool = new CfnUserPool(this, 'UserPool', {
  userPoolName: `${stackName}-user-pool`,
  policies: {
    passwordPolicy: {
      minimumLength: 8,
      requireLowercase: true,
      requireUppercase: true,
      requireNumbers: true,
      requireSymbols: false,
      temporaryPasswordValidityDays: 7,
    },
  },
  usernameConfiguration: {
    caseSensitive: false,
  },
  usernameAttributes: ['email'],
  autoVerifiedAttributes: ['email'],
  accountRecoverySetting: {
    recoveryMechanisms: [{ name: 'verified_email', priority: 1 }],
  },
  schema: [
    {
      name: 'email',
      attributeDataType: 'String',
      required: true,
      mutable: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'role',
      attributeDataType: 'String',
      required: false,
      mutable: true,
      developerOnlyAttribute: true,
    },
  ],
});

const userPoolClient = new CfnUserPoolClient(this, 'UserPoolClient', {
  userPoolId: userPool.ref,
  clientName: `${stackName}-client`,
  generateSecret: false,
  explicitAuthFlows: [
    'ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH',
    'ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH',
    'ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',
  ],
  accessTokenValidity: 8, // 8 hours
  idTokenValidity: 8, // 8 hours
  refreshTokenValidity: 30, // 30 days
  tokenValidityUnits: {
    accessToken: 'hours',
    idToken: 'hours',
    refreshToken: 'days',
  },
  supportedIdentityProviders: ['COGNITO'],
});

const userPoolDomain = new CfnUserPoolDomain(this, 'UserPoolDomain', {
  userPoolId: userPool.ref,
  domain: `${stackName}-auth-${this.account}`,
});
```

**Stack Outputs:**

```typescript
// Add to existing outputs in app-stack.ts
new CfnOutput(this, 'CognitoUserPoolId', {
  value: userPool.ref,
  exportName: `${stackName}-UserPoolId`,
  description: 'Cognito User Pool ID for API Gateway authorizer',
});

new CfnOutput(this, 'CognitoClientId', {
  value: userPoolClient.ref,
  exportName: `${stackName}-ClientId`,
  description: 'Cognito User Pool Client ID for frontend auth',
});

new CfnOutput(this, 'CognitoUserPoolDomain', {
  value: `https://${userPoolDomain.domain}.auth.${this.region}.amazoncognito.com`,
  exportName: `${stackName}-UserPoolDomain`,
  description: 'Cognito User Pool hosted UI domain URL',
});
```

**User Seeding Script Implementation:**

```typescript
// scripts/seed-users.ts
import { CognitoIdentityProvider } from '@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider';

const cognitoClient = new CognitoIdentityProvider({ region: 'us-west-2' });

// Script will read User Pool ID from CloudFormation stack outputs
// Must run AFTER successful CDK deployment
```

**Deployment Sequence:**

1. `npm run build` → Build CDK stack
2. `cdk deploy` → Deploy infrastructure with Cognito resources
3. `npm run seed-users` → Execute user seeding script (reads User Pool ID from stack outputs)
4. `npm run test` → Validate infrastructure and user creation

### Integration Context

From previous story completion notes:

- **Stack Integration:** Add Cognito to existing comprehensive app-stack.ts with VPC, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway
- **Cross-Stack References:** Stack outputs already configured for service integration
- **Deployment Process:** Use existing deployment scripts with npm run build before cdk deploy
- **AWS Account:** Validated deployment to account 357044226454 in us-west-2

## Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test Framework:** Jest 29.x for CDK unit testing (already configured in infrastructure workspace)
- **Test Location:** infrastructure/tests/unit/app-stack.test.ts (extend existing tests)
- **Test Standards:** Follow testing pyramid approach with emphasis on unit tests for CDK constructs
- **Specific Test Requirements:**
  - Test Cognito User Pool synthesis and configuration
  - Validate password policy settings
  - Test User Pool Client OAuth configuration
  - Verify custom attribute schema (custom:role)
  - Test stack outputs for User Pool ID, Client ID, and domain
  - Validate token expiration settings (8 hours)
