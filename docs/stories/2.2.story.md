# Story 2.2: Implement Lambda Authorizer with Role Validation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** security administrator,
**I want** API requests authorized based on Cognito JWT tokens and user roles,
**So that** only authenticated users can access the API.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Lambda authorizer function created to validate Cognito JWT tokens
2. Authorizer extracts and validates user role from custom:role attribute
3. API Gateway configured to use the Lambda authorizer for all endpoints
4. Authorizer caches results for performance (5-minute TTL)
5. Unauthorized requests return 401 with appropriate error message
6. Authorizer passes user context (email, role) to downstream Lambdas
7. Token expiration properly handled with clear error messages
8. Authorizer includes correlation ID for request tracing

### Technology Stack Details

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Backend Technologies:**

- **Backend Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ for type-safe backend development
- **Backend Framework:** AWS Lambda + Node.js 20.x for serverless compute runtime
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito for managed user authentication and JWT token validation
- **IaC Tool:** AWS CDK 2.100+ with TypeScript for infrastructure as code
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch for logs, metrics, and dashboards
- **Backend Testing:** Jest 29.x for Lambda function testing

### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Lambda Function Structure:**

- `apps/api/src/functions/auth/authorizer.ts` - Lambda authorizer function
- `apps/api/src/shared/middleware/` - Shared middleware utilities
- `apps/api/src/shared/utils/` - Backend utilities
- `apps/api/tests/unit/functions/auth/` - Authorizer unit tests

**CDK Infrastructure:**

- `infrastructure/lib/stacks/api-stack.ts` - Modify to add authorizer construct
- Authorizer Lambda must have CloudWatch logs permissions

### Authentication Architecture Details

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]

**Lambda Authorizer Implementation Pattern:**

```typescript
// Required authorizer response format
{
  principalId: payload.sub,
  policyDocument: {
    Version: '2012-10-17',
    Statement: [
      {
        Action: 'execute-api:Invoke',
        Effect: 'Allow',
        Resource: event.methodArn,
      },
    ],
  },
  context: {
    userId: payload.sub,
    email: payload.email,
    role: payload['custom:role'],
  },
}
```

**Required Dependencies:**

- `aws-jwt-verify` library for Cognito JWT token validation
- Environment variables: `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`, `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`

**JWT Token Validation Flow:**

1. Extract Bearer token from Authorization header
2. Verify JWT signature against Cognito User Pool
3. Extract claims: sub, email, custom:role
4. Generate IAM policy based on validation result
5. Return policy with user context for downstream functions

### Data Models and User Context

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]

**User Role Types:**

- `admin` - Full access to all operations including instance management
- `readonly` - View-only access to instances and metrics

**User Context Passed to Lambda Functions:**

```typescript
interface AuthorizerContext {
  userId: string; // Cognito user sub claim
  email: string; // User's email address
  role: 'admin' | 'readonly'; // Custom role attribute
}
```

### API Gateway Integration Requirements

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**Authorization Configuration:**

- All endpoints except `/health` require authorization
- JWT token in Authorization header with Bearer scheme
- Cache authorizer results for 5-minute TTL for performance
- Pass user context to all protected Lambda functions

**Error Response Standards:**

- 401 Unauthorized: Invalid, expired, or missing token
- 403 Forbidden: Valid token but insufficient permissions
- Include requestId/correlationId in all error responses

### CloudWatch Logging Requirements

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Authorizer Logging Standards:**

- Log all authorization attempts with user info and outcome
- Include correlation ID in all log entries for request tracing
- Log level: INFO for successful authorization, WARN for failures
- Log format: Structured JSON with timestamp, requestId, userId, action, outcome

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Implementation Rules:**

- Environment Variables: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: Must use standard error response format
- Input Validation: Validate all token inputs and handle malformed tokens gracefully
- Type Safety: Use TypeScript interfaces for all JWT claims and context objects
- Function Naming: camelCase for all function names

### CDK Infrastructure Configuration

**Authorizer Lambda Requirements:**

- Function name: `ec2-manager-authorizer`
- Runtime: Node.js 20.x
- Memory: 256 MB (sufficient for JWT validation)
- Timeout: 30 seconds
- Environment variables: COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID, COGNITO_CLIENT_ID
- IAM permissions: CloudWatch Logs (logs:CreateLogGroup, logs:CreateLogStream, logs:PutLogEvents)

**API Gateway Integration:**

- Authorizer type: REQUEST (to access full request context)
- Cache key parameters: Authorization header
- Cache TTL: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Apply to all methods except OPTIONS (for CORS preflight)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Test Location:** `apps/api/tests/unit/functions/auth/authorizer.test.ts`
**Testing Framework:** Jest 29.x with TypeScript support
**Coverage Requirements:** Minimum 80% for critical authorization logic

**Required Test Scenarios:**

1. Valid JWT token with admin role - should return Allow policy
2. Valid JWT token with readonly role - should return Allow policy
3. Expired JWT token - should throw Unauthorized error
4. Invalid JWT signature - should throw Unauthorized error
5. Malformed token format - should throw Unauthorized error
6. Missing Authorization header - should throw Unauthorized error
7. User context extraction and forwarding verification
8. Correlation ID generation and inclusion in responses

**Integration Test Requirements:**

- Test with actual Cognito-generated tokens
- Verify cache behavior and TTL expiration
- Test end-to-end flow with API Gateway
- Validate user context reaches downstream Lambda functions

### Security Review

**PASS** - Exemplary security implementation:

- ✅ Generic "Unauthorized" error responses prevent information leakage
- ✅ Proper JWT signature validation against Cognito User Pool
- ✅ Required claims validation (sub, email, custom:role)
- ✅ Role validation against allowed values (admin/readonly)
- ✅ Correlation ID tracking for security audit trails
- ✅ Structured logging without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Environment variable validation with secure error handling

**No security concerns identified.** Implementation follows security best practices.

### Performance Considerations

**CONCERNS** - Cache behavior not validated:

- ✅ 5-minute cache TTL configured in CDK (line 145 in api-stack.ts)
- ✅ 256MB memory allocation appropriate for JWT validation
- ✅ 30-second timeout reasonable for auth operations
- ⚠️ Cache behavior not tested - potential performance risk
- ⚠️ No load testing for concurrent authorization requests
- ⚠️ JWT verifier instance reuse pattern implemented but not performance validated

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified** - implementation was already of high quality and required no refactoring.
