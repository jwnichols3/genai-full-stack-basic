# Story 1.1: Initialize Monorepo and Development Environment

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly structured monorepo with all necessary tooling configured,
**So that** the team can efficiently develop and maintain all application components.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo initialized with npm workspaces containing web/, backend/, and infrastructure/ directories
2. Git repository created with proper .gitignore for Node.js, React, and CDK artifacts
3. Root package.json configured with workspace scripts for building and testing all components
4. TypeScript configured with strict mode for all workspaces with appropriate tsconfig.json files
5. ESLint and Prettier configured with shared rules across all workspaces
6. Development environment files (.env.dev, .env.prod) created with placeholder values
7. README.md created with setup instructions and project overview
8. Pre-commit hooks configured with Husky for linting and formatting

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the first story of the project.

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Root structure:** Must create ec2-instance-manager/ as project root
- **Apps directory:** apps/web/ for frontend, apps/api/ for backend
- **Packages directory:** packages/shared/ for shared types/utilities, packages/config/ for shared configuration
- **Infrastructure directory:** infrastructure/ for CDK code with lib/stacks/ and lib/constructs/
- **Scripts directory:** scripts/ for build/deploy scripts
- **Documentation:** docs/ directory for all documentation

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend:** TypeScript 5.3+, React 18.2+, Vite 5.0+ as build tool
- **Backend:** TypeScript 5.3+, Node.js 20.x for Lambda runtime
- **Infrastructure:** AWS CDK 2.100+ for Infrastructure as Code
- **Testing:** Jest 29.x for both frontend and backend unit testing
- **Build Tools:** Vite for frontend bundling and development

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **TypeScript:** Must use strict mode configuration
- **Type Sharing:** Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- **Environment Variables:** Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
  - Functions: camelCase
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  - File names: PascalCase for components, camelCase for others

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Organization:**
  - Frontend tests: apps/web/tests/ with unit/, integration/ subdirectories
  - Backend tests: apps/api/tests/ with unit/, integration/ subdirectories
- **Testing Framework:** Jest 29.x for unit and integration tests
- **Coverage Requirements:** Minimum 80% coverage for critical business logic
- **Test Scripts:** Must be included in workspace package.json files

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Root package.json:** Must contain workspace configuration and scripts
- **Root tsconfig.json:** Base TypeScript configuration for all workspaces
- **Workspace configs:** Each workspace needs its own package.json and tsconfig.json
- **Shared configs:** packages/config/eslint/, packages/config/typescript/, packages/config/jest/

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Version:** Must use 5.3+ across all workspaces for consistency
- **Node.js Version:** 20.x for Lambda compatibility
- **ESLint/Prettier:** Shared configuration to ensure consistent code style
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Must prevent commits that don't pass linting/formatting
- **AWS Configuration:** Must use AWS profile "jnicamzn-sso-ec2" and region "us-west-2" for all environments

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Locations:**
  - Frontend: apps/web/tests/unit/ and apps/web/tests/integration/
  - Backend: apps/api/tests/unit/ and apps/api/tests/integration/
- **Testing Framework:** Jest 29.x for unit testing
- **Test Standards:** Follow testing pyramid approach with emphasis on unit tests
- **Specific Requirements:** Each workspace must have test scripts configured in package.json
