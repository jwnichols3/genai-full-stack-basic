Approved

## Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** AWS CDK infrastructure properly scaffolded and deployable,
**So that** we can manage all AWS resources as code.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Base stack created with environment-specific configuration loading from config files
3. CDK can successfully synthesize CloudFormation templates without errors
4. Development environment can be deployed with `cdk deploy` command
5. Python deployment scripts created for orchestrating full deployments
6. Stack outputs properly configured for cross-stack references
7. CDK tests written to validate stack configurations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1:

- Monorepo structure successfully established with infrastructure/ workspace configured
- TypeScript strict mode configured across all workspaces including infrastructure/
- Jest testing framework already configured for infrastructure workspace
- AWS environment configured with profile "jnicamzn-sso-ec2" and region "us-west-2"

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **IaC Tool:** AWS CDK 2.100+ for Infrastructure as Code with TypeScript
- **Backend Language:** TypeScript 5.3+ for type-safe development
- **Backend Testing:** Jest 29.x for Lambda function and CDK testing
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration/Deployment with good AWS integration
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch for logs, metrics, and dashboards with native AWS service integration

### Project Structure Requirements

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- **Infrastructure Directory:** infrastructure/ for IaC definitions
- **Stack Structure:**
  - `lib/stacks/` for stack definitions (api-stack.ts, auth-stack.ts, web-stack.ts, data-stack.ts)
  - `lib/constructs/` for reusable CDK constructs
- **CDK Entry Point:** `bin/app.ts` as CDK application entry
- **Configuration:** `cdk.json` for CDK settings
- **Scripts Directory:** scripts/ for build/deploy scripts including deployment orchestration
- **Test Directory:** tests/ for CDK tests

### Coding Standards Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **TypeScript:** Must use strict mode configuration (already configured from Story 1.1)
- **Environment Variables:** Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - File names: camelCase for utilities, PascalCase for constructs/stacks
  - Functions: camelCase
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **AWS Configuration:** Must use AWS profile "jnicamzn-sso-ec2" and region "us-west-2"

### File Locations and Structure

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- **CDK App Entry:** `infrastructure/bin/app.ts`
- **Stack Files:** `infrastructure/lib/stacks/` (future stacks: api-stack.ts, auth-stack.ts, web-stack.ts, data-stack.ts)
- **CDK Configuration:** `infrastructure/cdk.json`
- **Test Files:** `infrastructure/tests/unit/` for CDK unit tests
- **Deployment Scripts:** `scripts/` for Python deployment orchestration
- **Configuration Files:** Use existing `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` from Story 1.1

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test File Locations:** infrastructure/tests/unit/ for CDK unit tests
- **Testing Framework:** Jest 29.x for CDK unit testing (already configured from Story 1.1)
- **Test Standards:** Follow testing pyramid approach with emphasis on unit tests
- **Coverage Requirements:** Minimum 80% coverage for critical business logic
- **Test Scripts:** Infrastructure workspace already has Jest configured in package.json

### Technical Constraints

- **CDK Version:** Must use 2.100+ for latest features and security
- **TypeScript Version:** Must use 5.3+ (already configured from Story 1.1)
- **AWS Environment:** Must use profile "jnicamzn-sso-ec2" and region "us-west-2" (already configured)
- **Environment Configuration:** Load environment-specific settings from existing .env.dev/.env.prod files

### Backend Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

- **Service Architecture:** Infrastructure must support future Lambda functions organized in api/src/functions/ structure
- **Database Requirements:** Must prepare for DynamoDB tables (audit-logs table for audit trail)
- **Authentication:** Must support future Cognito integration for JWT validation
- **API Gateway:** Must prepare for REST API architecture with proper CORS and authorization

### Data Models Context

[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

- **Future Data Requirements:** Infrastructure must support AuditLog storage in DynamoDB
- **User Management:** Must prepare for Cognito User Pool integration
- **CloudWatch Integration:** Must support metrics collection for EC2Instance monitoring

## Testing

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Test File Locations:** infrastructure/tests/unit/ for CDK stack unit tests
- **Testing Framework:** Jest 29.x for unit testing (already configured)
- **Test Standards:** Follow testing pyramid approach focusing on unit tests for CDK constructs
- **Specific Requirements:**
  - Test CDK stack synthesis and resource configuration
  - Validate environment-specific configurations
  - Test deployment script functionality
  - Infrastructure workspace test scripts already configured in package.json
