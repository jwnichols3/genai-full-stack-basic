# AWS EC2 Instance Management Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Provide a centralized web interface for monitoring and managing EC2 instances across a specific AWS account and region
- Enable role-based access control with differentiated permissions for admin and read-only users
- Reduce operational overhead by 50% compared to using AWS Console directly
- Deliver secure authentication and authorization through AWS Cognito integration
- Create a responsive, intuitive UI using React and Material-UI that simplifies complex AWS operations
- Establish monitoring and observability through CloudWatch integration
- Build a scalable serverless architecture using AWS managed services
- Achieve 99.9% uptime with sub-3 second page load times

### Background Context

The AWS EC2 Instance Management Platform addresses the need for a streamlined interface to monitor and manage EC2 instances without requiring deep AWS Console expertise. Currently, operations teams spend significant time navigating the AWS Console for routine instance monitoring and management tasks. This platform consolidates these operations into a user-friendly dashboard that provides real-time visibility and controlled administrative actions. By leveraging serverless AWS services and modern frontend technologies, the solution ensures scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness while reducing the learning curve for team members who need to interact with EC2 infrastructure.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The platform provides a clean, professional interface that prioritizes information clarity and action efficiency. Following Material Design principles, the UI emphasizes visual hierarchy, consistent interactions, and responsive feedback. The dashboard-centric design enables users to quickly assess instance health at a glance while providing progressive disclosure for detailed information. The experience mirrors modern cloud management tools while eliminating complexity through focused functionality.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Real-time status indicators** using color coding (green=running, yellow=pending, red=stopped)
- **Contextual actions** appearing on hover/selection to reduce visual clutter
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions with clear consequences
- **Toast notifications** for operation feedback without disrupting workflow
- **Responsive data tables** with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users to navigate and execute common actions

### Core Screens and Views

- **Login Screen** - Cognito authentication with email/password, forgot password flow
- **Main Dashboard** - Grid/list view of EC2 instances with status overview
- **Instance Detail View** - Comprehensive instance information with metrics and actions
- **User Profile/Settings** - Session management, preferences, theme selection
- **Audit Log View** (Admin only) - Searchable history of all administrative actions
- **Error/404 Pages** - Helpful error states with navigation recovery

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Following WCAG AA standards with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, proper ARIA labels, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

### Branding

Clean, professional aesthetic aligned with AWS design language. Material-UI components with AWS orange (#FF9900) as primary accent color. Focus on data visualization clarity over decorative elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Responsive web application optimized for:

- Desktop (1920x1080 primary target)
- Tablet (landscape and portrait)
- Mobile (basic support for monitoring on-the-go)

## Technical Assumptions

- **State Management**: React Context API with useReducer (upgrade to Redux Toolkit if complexity grows)
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for Lambda function packaging
- **Deployment**: Python scripts orchestrating CDK deployments with environment-specific configurations
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, and Dashboards for all components
- **Security**: IAM roles with least privilege, API throttling, input validation on all endpoints
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branch workflow (main → develop → feature branches)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Development Tools**: ESLint with airbnb-typescript config, Prettier for formatting, Husky for pre-commit hooks
- **Package Management**: npm workspaces for monorepo dependency management
- **Environment Management**: .env files for local development, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for deployed environments
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict origin validation, credentials not included in requests
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Database**: No database initially (stateless), DynamoDB considered for future session/preference storage
- **Caching**: CloudFront for static assets, API Gateway caching for appropriate GET endpoints
