# Deployment Status - BMaD Documentation

## Current Status: AWS Authentication Successful, Deployment Blocked

**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Phase**: Infrastructure Deployment Setup
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Authentication working, deployment blocked by test failures

## Battle-tested Metrics and Data (BMaD)

### ✅ Completed Objectives
1. **IAM User Creation**: `github-actions-ec2-manager` created in account `357044226454`
2. **Permission Policy**: Comprehensive CDK deployment policy attached
3. **GitHub Secrets**: AWS credentials configured and validated
4. **Pipeline Authentication**: "Configure AWS credentials" step succeeds ✅
5. **Workflow Triggers**: Infrastructure Deployment workflow triggers correctly

### ❌ Blocking Issues Preventing CloudFormation Deployment
1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: Integration tests failing with TS18048 errors
2. **ESLint Configuration**: Missing `.eslintrc` files in multiple workspaces
3. **Pipeline Gate Failure**: Infrastructure tests must pass before deployment stages execute

### 📊 Pipeline Execution Data

**Latest Infrastructure Deployment Run**: `17710641655`
- ✅ AWS Authentication: SUCCESS
- ✅ Dependencies Installation: SUCCESS
- ❌ Infrastructure Tests: FAILED (TypeScript errors)
- 🚫 CDK Deployment: NOT REACHED (blocked by test failures)

**Error Pattern**:
```
TS18048: 'stack' is possibly 'undefined'
TS2339: Property 'TimeToLiveDescription' does not exist on type 'TableDescription'
```

### 🎯 Success Criteria (Not Yet Met)
- [ ] CloudFormation stack deployment to AWS
- [ ] Infrastructure resources created in target account
- [ ] Post-deployment validation successful
- [ ] Green pipeline with all quality gates passed

### 📋 Required Actions
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors in integration tests
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Add ESLint configuration files to all workspaces
3. **VALIDATE**: Trigger full deployment pipeline after fixes
4. **VERIFY**: Confirm CloudFormation resources created in AWS account

## Battle-tested Assessment

**Capability**: AWS deployment infrastructure is correctly configured
**Blocker**: Code quality gates preventing deployment execution
**Risk**: Medium - authentication works, but deployment untested
**Next Phase**: Fix compilation errors → validate full deployment cycle
