**Next Review:** 2025-12-14

## Infrastructure Overview

The EC2 Manager application is built on AWS using a comprehensive cloud-native architecture designed for scalability, security, and operational excellence. The infrastructure supports multiple environments (development, staging, production) with identical patterns for consistency and reduced operational overhead.

### Cloud Provider & Core Services

- **Primary Cloud Provider:** AWS (us-west-2 region)
- **Infrastructure as Code:** AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- **Core Services:**
  - **Compute:** AWS Lambda for serverless API processing
  - **Storage:** Amazon DynamoDB for audit trails, S3 for static web hosting
  - **Networking:** VPC with public/private subnets, API Gateway for API management
  - **Security:** Amazon Cognito for user authentication, IAM roles for access control
  - **Monitoring:** CloudWatch for metrics, logs, and alarms
  - **Distribution:** CloudFront for global content delivery

### Regional Architecture

- **Primary Region:** us-west-2 (Oregon)
- **Availability Zones:** 2 AZs for high availability
- **Single-region deployment** with plans for multi-region expansion in Phase 3

### Multi-Environment Strategy

Three identical environments with environment-specific configurations:

| Environment     | Purpose                         | Features                              | Retention Policies                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Development** | Feature development and testing | Relaxed security, cost-optimized      | 7 days log retention, DESTROY removal policy  |
| **Staging**     | Pre-production validation       | Production-like configuration         | 14 days log retention, mixed removal policies |
| **Production**  | Live system                     | Full security, monitoring, and backup | 30 days log retention, RETAIN removal policy  |

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Tools & Frameworks

- **Primary:** AWS CDK v2 with TypeScript
- **Build System:** Node.js 20.x with npm workspaces
- **Testing:** Jest for unit and integration tests
- **Validation:** CDK diff and synth for pre-deployment validation

- **Access Control:** Restricted to QA and senior development team
- **Data Classification:** Anonymized production-like data

**Production Environment**

- **Purpose:** Live customer-facing system
- **Resources:** Full production capacity with auto-scaling
- **Access Control:** Strict access controls with MFA required
- **Data Classification:** Sensitive customer and operational data

### Secret Management

- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:** Configuration parameters

## Network Architecture

### VPC/VNET Design

- **VPC CIDR:** 10.0.0.0/16
- **Subnets:**
  - Public Subnets: 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24 (2 AZs)
  - Private Subnets: 10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24 (2 AZs)

### Subnet Strategy

- **Public Subnets:** Load balancers, NAT gateways, bastion hosts
- **Private Subnets:** Application servers, databases, internal services
- **Isolated Subnets:** Future use for highly sensitive workloads

### Security Groups & NACLs

- **API Gateway Security Group:** HTTPS (443) from CloudFront only

- **Default NACL:** Allow all traffic (security enforced at security group level)

### Load Balancers & API Gateways

- **API Gateway:** Regional API Gateway for REST APIs
- **CloudFront:** Global CDN for web content and API caching
- **No Application Load Balancer:** Serverless architecture uses managed services

4. Health check validation
5. Notification dispatch

### Rollback Procedures

**Automatic Rollback Triggers:**

- Health check failures

**Manual Rollback Process:**

```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh <environment> [target]
```

**Rollback Capabilities:**

- Infrastructure changes affecting data retention
- Security configuration modifications

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

**Automated Backups:**

- DynamoDB: Point-in-time recovery for production (35 days)
- S3: Versioning enabled for web assets
- Lambda: Code stored in Git with deployment artifacts
- CloudFormation: Stack templates exported nightly

**Backup Validation:**

- Monthly restore testing in development environment
- Backup integrity checks via CloudWatch alarms
- Recovery time objective (RTO): 4 hours
- Recovery point objective (RPO): 1 hour

### Recovery Procedures

**Disaster Scenarios:**

1. **Region Failure:**
   - Manual failover to secondary region (planned for Phase 3)
   - DNS update for traffic redirection
   - Data replication from backups

2. **Data Corruption:**
   - Point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB
   - S3 object version restoration
   - Application rollback to last known good state

3. **Security Breach:**
   - Immediate access revocation via IAM
   - Network isolation using security groups
   - System restore from clean backup

### RTO & RPO Targets

| Scenario                   | RTO Target | RPO Target | Recovery Method        |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| **Application Error**      | 15 minutes | 0 minutes  | Lambda rollback        |
| **Data Corruption**        | 2 hours    | 1 hour     | Point-in-time recovery |
| **Infrastructure Failure** | 4 hours    | 1 hour     | CloudFormation restore |
| **Region Outage**          | 8 hours    | 4 hours    | Cross-region failover  |

### DR Testing Approach

**Monthly Testing:**
