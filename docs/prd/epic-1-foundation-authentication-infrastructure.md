# Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish the complete project foundation including monorepo setup, AWS CDK infrastructure scaffolding, and functional authentication system with Cognito. This epic delivers a deployable application with authenticated access, proving the core infrastructure works end-to-end while establishing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

## Story 1.1: Initialize Monorepo and Development Environment

**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly structured monorepo with all necessary tooling configured,
**So that** the team can efficiently develop and maintain all application components.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Monorepo initialized with npm workspaces containing web/, backend/, and infrastructure/ directories
2. Git repository created with proper .gitignore for Node.js, React, and CDK artifacts
3. Root package.json configured with workspace scripts for building and testing all components
4. TypeScript configured with strict mode for all workspaces with appropriate tsconfig.json files
5. ESLint and Prettier configured with shared rules across all workspaces
6. Development environment files (.env.dev, .env.prod) created with placeholder values
7. README.md created with setup instructions and project overview
8. Pre-commit hooks configured with Husky for linting and formatting

## Story 1.2: Setup CDK Infrastructure Foundation

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** AWS CDK infrastructure properly scaffolded and deployable,
**So that** we can manage all AWS resources as code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. CDK application initialized with TypeScript and proper stack structure
2. Base stack created with environment-specific configuration loading from config files
3. CDK can successfully synthesize CloudFormation templates without errors
4. Development environment can be deployed with `cdk deploy` command
5. Python deployment scripts created for orchestrating full deployments
6. Stack outputs properly configured for cross-stack references
7. CDK tests written to validate stack configurations

## Story 1.3: Implement Cognito User Pool and Authentication

**As a** security administrator,
**I want** AWS Cognito properly configured with pre-registered users,
**So that** only authorized users can access the platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Cognito User Pool created with email-based sign-in enabled
2. Password policy enforced (min 12 chars, upper/lower/digit/symbol required)
3. All 4 pre-registered users created with correct roles (admin/readonly) as custom attributes
4. User Pool Client configured with appropriate OAuth flows and token expiration (8 hours)
5. MFA optionally configurable but not required for initial implementation
6. Password reset flow functional via email
7. User Pool domain configured for hosted UI (fallback option)

## Story 1.4: Create React Application Shell with Routing

**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** a React application shell with Material-UI and routing configured,
**So that** we can build the user interface on a solid foundation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. React application created with TypeScript using Vite as build tool
2. Material-UI installed and theme configured with AWS color scheme
3. React Router configured with routes for /login, /dashboard, and /404
4. Basic layout components created (Header, Footer, Layout wrapper)
5. Environment variable configuration for API endpoints and Cognito settings
6. Application builds successfully and runs in development mode
7. Basic responsive design implemented for mobile/tablet/desktop

## Story 1.5: Implement Frontend Authentication Flow

**As a** user,
**I want** to securely log in to the application using my email and password,
**So that** I can access the EC2 management features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Login page created with Material-UI form components for email/password
2. Integration with Cognito using AWS Amplify or AWS SDK for authentication
3. JWT tokens properly stored and managed (memory/sessionStorage, not localStorage)
4. Protected routes that redirect to login when unauthenticated
5. Logout functionality that clears tokens and redirects to login
6. Error handling for invalid credentials with user-friendly messages
7. Loading states during authentication requests
8. Successful login redirects to dashboard route

## Story 1.6: Deploy to S3/CloudFront and Implement CI/CD

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** the frontend deployed to S3/CloudFront with automated pipelines,
**So that** we have a reliable deployment process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. S3 bucket created with proper configuration for static website hosting
2. CloudFront distribution configured pointing to S3 origin
3. Frontend build artifacts successfully deployed to S3
4. CloudFront serves the application with proper cache headers
5. GitHub Actions workflow created for automated testing on PR
6. Deployment automation via Python scripts functional
7. Development environment accessible via CloudFront URL
8. Proper error page handling for SPA routing (404 -> index.html)
