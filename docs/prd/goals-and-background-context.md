# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable role-based access control with differentiated permissions for admin and read-only users
- Reduce operational overhead by 50% compared to using AWS Console directly
- Deliver secure authentication and authorization through AWS Cognito integration
- Create a responsive, intuitive UI using React and Material-UI that simplifies complex AWS operations
- Establish monitoring and observability through CloudWatch integration
- Build a scalable serverless architecture using AWS managed services
- Achieve 99.9% uptime with sub-3 second page load times

## Background Context

The AWS EC2 Instance Management Platform addresses the need for a streamlined interface to monitor and manage EC2 instances without requiring deep AWS Console expertise. Currently, operations teams spend significant time navigating the AWS Console for routine instance monitoring and management tasks. This platform consolidates these operations into a user-friendly dashboard that provides real-time visibility and controlled administrative actions. By leveraging serverless AWS services and modern frontend technologies, the solution ensures scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness while reducing the learning curve for team members who need to interact with EC2 infrastructure.
