# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The platform provides a clean, professional interface that prioritizes information clarity and action efficiency. Following Material Design principles, the UI emphasizes visual hierarchy, consistent interactions, and responsive feedback. The dashboard-centric design enables users to quickly assess instance health at a glance while providing progressive disclosure for detailed information. The experience mirrors modern cloud management tools while eliminating complexity through focused functionality.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Card-based layouts** for instance display with expandable details
- **Real-time status indicators** using color coding (green=running, yellow=pending, red=stopped)
- **Contextual actions** appearing on hover/selection to reduce visual clutter
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions with clear consequences
- **Toast notifications** for operation feedback without disrupting workflow
- **Responsive data tables** with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users to navigate and execute common actions

## Core Screens and Views

- **Login Screen** - Cognito authentication with email/password, forgot password flow
- **Main Dashboard** - Grid/list view of EC2 instances with status overview
- **Instance Detail View** - Comprehensive instance information with metrics and actions
- **User Profile/Settings** - Session management, preferences, theme selection
- **Audit Log View** (Admin only) - Searchable history of all administrative actions
- **Error/404 Pages** - Helpful error states with navigation recovery
