3. Tests run against deployed development environment
4. Screenshots captured on test failures
5. Multiple browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
6. Mobile viewport testing for responsive design
7. E2E tests integrated into deployment pipeline
8. Test reports generated with pass/fail metrics

## Story 4.4: Create CloudWatch Monitoring Dashboard

**As a** operations engineer,
**I want** a comprehensive monitoring dashboard,
**So that** I can track platform health and performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. CloudWatch dashboard created with key metrics widgets
2. API Gateway metrics: requests, latency, 4xx/5xx errors
3. Lambda metrics: invocations, duration, errors, throttles
4. Cognito metrics: sign-ins, sign-up, token refreshes
5. CloudFront metrics: requests, cache hit rate, origin latency
6. Custom metrics for business KPIs (active users, actions performed)
7. Dashboard organized by service with clear sections
8. Time range selector for historical analysis

## Story 4.5: Configure CloudWatch Alarms and Notifications

**As a** operations engineer,
**I want** automated alerting for critical issues,
**So that** we can respond quickly to problems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. SNS topic created for alarm notifications
2. Alarms configured for: high error rate (>1%), high latency (>3s)
3. Lambda throttling alarm when concurrent executions approach limit
4. Cognito authentication failure spike detection
5. CloudFront origin error rate monitoring
6. Alarms use appropriate thresholds and evaluation periods
7. Email notifications sent to operations team
8. Alarm descriptions include remediation steps

## Story 4.6: Implement Performance Optimizations

**As a** user,
**I want** fast, responsive application performance,
**So that** I can efficiently manage instances.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Lambda functions optimized with connection pooling for AWS SDK
2. API Gateway caching enabled for GET endpoints (5-minute TTL)
3. CloudFront caching headers optimized for static assets
4. React code splitting implemented for route-based chunks
5. Material-UI tree shaking configured to reduce bundle size
6. Image assets optimized and served in modern formats
7. Performance metrics meet requirements (<3s initial load)
8. Lighthouse audit score >90 for performance

## Story 4.7: Create Production Deployment Pipeline

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** a reliable production deployment process,
**So that** we can safely release updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Production CDK stacks configured with appropriate limits
2. Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
3. Automated smoke tests run after deployment
4. Rollback capability if smoke tests fail
5. Production deployment requires manual approval
6. Change log automatically generated from git commits
7. Deployment notifications sent to team
8. Production configuration uses stricter security settings

## Story 4.8: Implement Security Hardening

**As a** security engineer,
**I want** production-grade security measures,
**So that** the platform is protected from threats.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Security headers configured in CloudFront (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
2. API input validation on all endpoints using Joi or Zod
3. SQL injection prevention (if database implemented)
4. XSS protection through proper React escaping
5. Secrets managed through AWS Secrets Manager
6. IAM roles follow least privilege principle
7. Security scanning integrated into CI pipeline
